1. Write a program that that demonstrates use of four basic principles of
object-oriented programming /Abstraction/, /Encapsulation/, /Inheritance/ and
/Polymorphism/.

2. Use /Abstraction/ to define different classes for each person type such as Student
and Instructor. These classes should have behavior for that type of person.

3. Use /Encapsulation/ to keep many details private in each class.

4. Use /Inheritance/ by leveraging the implementation already created in the Person
class to save code in Student and Instructor classes.

5. Use /Polymorphism/ to create virtual methods that derived classes could override to
create specific behavior such as salary calculations.
