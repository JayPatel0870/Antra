result back at the console.

Convert the string to char array, reverse it, then convert it to string again
Print the letters of the string in back direction (from the last to the first) in a for-loop

2. Write a program that reverses the words in a given sentence without changing the
punctuation and spaces
Use the following separators between the words: . , : ; = ( ) & [ ] " ' \ / ! ? (space).
All other characters are considered part of words, e.g. C++, a+b, and a77 are
considered valid words.
The sentences always start by word and end by separator.
